# `cedar-forest-game`

This is a game that popularises [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en), which is a language for defining permissions
as policies, which describe who should have access to what. It is also a specification for evaluating those policies.
Use Cedar policies to control what each user of your application is permitted to do and what resources they may access.

Stay tuned for more! :hourglass: :mushroom: :evergreen_tree:
